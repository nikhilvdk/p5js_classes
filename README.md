I was inspired to create a dynamic sketch that incorporated my favorite animal as a child: penguins. I wanted to incorporate interaction between them, so there are "fisher" penguins who go out to sea to catch fish and pass them onto the others who stay back in the colony.
I combined this theme with an inspiration for path-following from Nature of Code.
Working on this sketch fully exposed me to the power and utility of classes for multi-agent systems.
